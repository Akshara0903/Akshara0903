_Merging science with machine learning to shape the future of healthcare_

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Akshara!  
I'm a Master's graduate in **Biomanufacturing** with hands-on experience in upstream and downstream processing, process validation, and digital systems (MES, PI Vision, SAP).  
Now, I'm diving into the world of **AI/ML** to apply data-driven solutions in **biotech and pharma**, where innovation matters most.

I believe in bringing **biology, coding, and creativity** together to make bioprocessing smarter, faster, and more sustainable. 🌱
